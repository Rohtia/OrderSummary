## My process

I started by looking at the mobile design provided, taking notes on the different sections of the page I would need. Once I got the basic HTML page laid out, I started coding the CSS, from the top of the page down, with the mobile view first. The final bit of the mobile-first styling was to add in the hover psuedoclass for the links and the button.

Once the mobile view was coded up, I added two media queries: one for minimum device view width of 500px, and another with a minimum device view width of 1440px. The style guide for the challenge listed the desktop size as 1440px. But there is a a *huge* difference in size between 375px for mobile and 1440px for desktop, so I set a middle media query at minimum 500px to allow for a slightly larger order summary card with also using the desktop background image. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to refresh what I had previously learned regarding media queries. 

Getting the background image to cover the screen properly (as it is depicted in the sample image) without either ending early and leaving a section of the width empty or being stretched too tall was a challenge. I had never used a background image that doesn't *actually* take up the whole background before, so that was good practice.

### Continued development

While I think I've got CSS Grid figured out in terms of designating the rows and columns, as well as assigning which sections/divs to the various grid points by row/column number, I *do* need to continue practicing how to align and justify the contents within the grid. Particularly with regard to the baseline.
